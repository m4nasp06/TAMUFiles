/* This line is a comment.
*  This file contains a function which always return 2.
*  You will learn more about this later.
*/

// Things to note today:
// 1) Comments are part of code that are ignored by computer.
// 2) In Java there are two types of comments. 
//    Single line comments (starting with //)
//    Multi-Line comments (enclosed by /*  */)
// 3) You can compile this file with javac. 
//    But you cannot run it because it has no main function.
// 4) Change the number 2 to something else and submit on gradescope.
