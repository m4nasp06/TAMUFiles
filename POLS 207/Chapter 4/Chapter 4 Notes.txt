Advantages to multiple levels of gov - 
1. Efficiency (local needs catered for)
2. Equity (those who contribute benefit)
3. Participation (local decisions affect local decision makers)
4. Protection against Tyranny (difficult to take power from dispersed power centers)
5. Choice (Relocation resolves conflicts with previous state/local governance)


No Government Period - 1776-1850

Americans lived in rural settings
Dispersed population, very self dependant
Barely any gov interactions, and if there was, it was negative
Country officials were basically "government"
-Record Keeping, property protection and ownership record keeping
"Best Government is least government"
Did not depend on gov for help
Families are self dependant, but count on neighbors - "community"


Municipal Government Period - 1850-1895

American cities grew in size
-Industrial Revolution, Immigration, Urbanization

Increasing city population demanded large scale services-
-Water, Sewage, Crime, Health, Building Codes, Mass Education
-Municipal governments had to grow in power and scope to tackle these, but led to increase in corruption

Increase in Political Corruption 
-Leaders built networks to build and keep power (political machines)
-Fed on corruption and bribes
-Drew votes from immigrants

Good things emerging in the time - 
Most participation in elections
Organization was critical to winning elections (getting immigrants to vote together)
Ideas such as:
-Government should work for public interest
-Government should uphold public trust

People realized those in power had to do right by the people, and could be called out 
Corruption couldn't be defeated in local elections, so people moved to state government contest 


State-Intercity Government Period - 1895-1932
Public corruption was still rampant in cities
State government worked to fix this-
Dillon Rule - 
Local governments are creations of the state, and must comply with state statutes
Non partisan city elections (no parties on ballots)
All municipal hires are civil service - merit>loyalty
School districts were separated from municipal governments
Reform Movement - by appealing to state government, able to reduce the power of political machines
The evidence of reforms workng led to the belief that laws shape behavior and the results
American Federal System - if one system cannot fix something, move up a level and win there
States Powers - 
regulate intercity and intrastate commerce
require municipalities to institute health and building codes
State laws > local laws


Federal Government Era - 1932-1981
At the time, US gov working to help recover from Great Depression
-Federal Income Tax in 1932
Federal Government becomes "guardian" and "protector"
Income for the elderly and disabled
Gave jobs to AMerican labor
Ensured education quaility, civil rights, clean environment
Defended country against existential threats (World Wars, Communism, Nuclear Annihilation)
Development of national standards - new supremacy over state laws
Criminal: rights of the accused, capital punishment
Social - education, pornography, abortion
Regulation of the economy - Monopoly prevention, worker safety, environmental regulation
Federal taxation and spending gave tools to the Feds to do things that previously States had large jurisdiction in
Large grants of federal money secured state cooperation (funds given to states wiht strings attatched)
Ability for federal to go into deficit spending gave advantage over states(states cannot do this)
For all problems, generally turn to federal government


New Federalism Era - 1980-Present

Reagan Administration started New Federalism

Three Tenets - 
Individuals make better decisions than institutions
Businesses make better decisions than governments
Governments closer to people > Governments distant from people

Proponents believed - 
1. Private sector > Public Sector
2. Less government > More government
3. State and local governments make better decisions than federal governments

Argument of cycle of roles of power in state governments and federal,
one has power at one point, and it switches

5 Factors contribute to the trend of state power in 1980
1. New Federalism of Reagan administration wanted to cut federal underwriting to domestic programs (states either payed or abandoned programs)
2. The modernization of state governments (improved managerial and technical capacity)
3. Re-apportionment of state legislatures - more power to those in cities and suburbs
4. South caught up with the rest of the states in government resource capacity
5. States overreacted to the sharp recession of the US economy by pasing new taxes and sharply reducing expenses, so economy recovering led to states having many reserves to innovate

The federal share of total expenditure peaked during and after WW2, and declined until Vietnam War in the 1960's

Increase in Nixon/Ford and Carter

Presidents Reagan and George HW Bush gave more responsibility to state and loca governments, reducing federal share of spending
- Increase of federal grants to state and loca governments
-Federal Government took the blame for revenue while state and local govs took credit for benefits of spending

New Federalism gave power to the states, with massive deregulation to give power to the private sector, with tax cuts to transfer power from gov to citizens
- Goals such as decreased federal spending and change annual federal deficit to annual surplus

There was a federal income tax decrease during the Reagan admin, with a decrease in federal spending causing growth in the private sector
-However, the decrease in income taxes was accompanied by an increase in payroll taxes
	-Led to decrease in taxes paid by corps and increased share of taxes paid by wage earners
The shift of burden of federal income taxes met the goal of promoting the strength of the private sector
- Also a shift of burden frmo highter to lower income families
- Tax changes, and improvements to the economy contributed to stable federal spending for six years

Federal Spending did increase in the last years of the bush presidency due to the Gulf War

President Bush signed a tax increase bill, with a combination of consistently declining federal spending, and another tax increase in the Clinton Presidency, led to a federal budget surplus

Clinton supported New Federalism, and total government spending remained constant, and with increasing federal grants, state and local govs increased their share of total spending

The Bush Admin and Republical Congress implemented significant tax cuts and deregulation of the private sector, and wanting a balanced federal budget, federal spending increased

George W Bush admin federal share increased due to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and due to Medicare benefits

Tax cuts and spending were financed to borrowing and federal debt, and massive increases in spending were caused by the collapse of the finance sector

Federal bailout programs in Bush admin continued during Obama Admin, the recession trigerring a number of Financial expenditures, such as supporting large financial institutions and and auto companies, stimulation of the economy, federal welfare and unemployment benefits, with a significant decline in tax revenues of state and local govs

Federal expenditures decreased in 2011, due to a limit on federal spending known as sequestration
-Republican Congress refused to continue all stimulus programs and limit spending on entitlements that increased with economic collapse

The New Federalism Era ended in 2001-2011

Gridlock Era came after, in which Repubs and Democ could agree on basically nothing

Mitch McConnell, minority leader, once becoming majority leader in 2011 delayed or blocked executive branch initiatives

Republican Party in Congress refused to authorize federal borrowing and spending, leading to shut downs in 2013 and 2015
 
Mitch refused to do anything on the Supreme Court nomination after Anton Scalia died in Feb 2016, and nothing happened until Donald Trump won

Senate rules were changed to require only majority approval,not 60% approval

Republican House and Senate found ways to take actions without support from minority party Democrats

These events led to a new era called the Tea Party Era, the Anti-Federal Era, or the Era of Minimum Bipartisan Participation

At the federal level, both major parties respect the New Federalism Era, and accuse each other of violating it

Tea Party Members( Minority within Republican Party) accused Bush and Obama and constantly violating New Federalism Principles

Many state governments chose to resist and act agaisnt federal initiatives

Texas rejected a small amount of federal stimulus funding, and spent most of the funding it accepted to replace state funds
-Rather than sustaining local govs, it kept taxes low, and maintained a large emergency fund

Many states rejected the expansion of medical insurance to low income families throw Medicaid, rejecting federal funding

Party Affiliation accounts for state participation in federal initiatives essentially

Central Ideas - 
Federal government better achieves some goals by collecting taxes and giving more responsibility to state and local governments

Lowering government taxing and spending can be beneficial by permitting individuals to make their own decisions

Governemnts should take responsibility in softening economic harships, help in old age, and assure health coverage

Federal government should take responsibility when private sector failures cause economic catastrophes

National defense and international involvement also continuing responsibilities of the national government

States have the ability to resist and work against federal programs




4B Lecture - Federalism and State Constitutions - 
Unitary - People -> Central Government
Confederacy - People -> State Government -> Central Government
Federal - People -> State Government
				 -> Federal Government

Federalism allocates power to top and lower level governments
American federalism assigns gov powers to State and natinal
Federal Law > State law
Lots of debate over proper power allocation

Power Dance - 
States regularly contest federal supremacy
New Federalism attempted to reset allocation to favor states based on 2.5 Tenets
1. Decisions - Individuals & Business make better decisions
-1.5 If gov has to make decisions, keep as close to local as possible
2.5 - Less is better

New Federalists expected significant transfer of power from federal to state
States realized that with responsibilities came new bills, and need for new taxes

Primary Responsibilities - 
Federal - 
National Defense
Postal Service
Space program

State - 
Education
Highway and transport
Health
Sanitation
Fire
Police
(Many of these require significant federal fudning and involvement)

Shared - 
Welfare
Employment services
Unemployment compensation

State and Local spending increased much more than Federal

Federal Share of total government spending decreased steadily until Bush'43 and Obama

Some believe states should get money without requirements, some say states should get less funds
8 reasons why - 
1. federal money has no magical source
2. Grants can sometimes lead to wasteful spending
3. Aid allocation doesn't match consistent idea of need
4. Grants reduce state policy diversity
5. Grant regulations breed bureaucracy(complex chain and web structure)
6. Grants cause policymaking overload
7. Grants make government responsibilities unclear
8. Common problems aren't always national priorities

Purpose of constitutions - 
Legitimacy
Organizes government
Allocates power in government
Limits government power (establishing power)

State Constitutions
-Separation of powers same as at federal ssytem
Many checks and balances are similar
post Colonial, States shifted to making governments weaker
Post Civil War - States wanted to reserve even more, to keep progressive governments in check

State desire to control government is reflected in length of constitution
-US = 9000 words
Alabama(longest) has 365,000 words

Long constitutions have many detailed restrictions, and preserve them by making ot hard to alter or revoke
States need electorate to ratify changes
Proposals generally come from legislature
Allows winning groups to safeguard their interests

State to Local - 
Similar heirarchy, with constitution, state statutes, and local government ordinances
-But Dillon Rule - state tells local governments what they can and can't do
Local governments have no inherent powers

State Constitutions have Bill of Rights
-Cannot deny US Constitution rights, but may specify more rights

Southern States have had many different constitutions due to - 
Secession
Losing Civil War
Reconstruction
White Power after Reconstruction

Texas Constitution is very long, very detailed, poorly organizde
Strongly Conservative
Agrarian in interest

Constains lots of deadwood
-Unenforceable provisions that conflict with US Constitution (As long as you believe in God part of Bill of Rights)

Texas vs US Constitution - 
Similar in structure, but US is much more flexible in allowing Government to act
